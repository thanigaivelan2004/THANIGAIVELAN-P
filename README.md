# 1st problem<br>
I just used a calculator class to solve the problem and perform operations like +,*,-,/

# 2nd problem<br>
I just print the odd numbers until the given range of a. by using the small formula 2*a-1 <br>

# 3rd problem<br>
I just print the odd numbers until the given range  like 2nd problem but here if the range in even numbers i want to print the odd number range.<br>
Eg: if n=4 i want to print 1,3,5 the odds range, So i Subtract 1 from given a if it is even.
